## The flow

1. Auth - do this later
2. You can see all the shifts you're currently getting notified about. Examples:

- Receiving Stocking on Mondays and Wednesdays between 5pm - 10pm
- Dairy Lifting
- Any shift on Tuesdays between 8am - 12pm 

3. Add shift and/or time you'd like to be notified about

- Shift you'd like to be notified about (Includes any, can be 1)
- Days + times for the shift (Includes any, can be 0 to many)

4. Settings to update the email that receives notifications

## Considerations

- Going to to need to store their password somewhere safely
- Maybe has an onboarding flow for someone to fill out their food coop details
